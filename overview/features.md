# Features

1. **Support for Solana-Based Assets:** \
   One of the standout features of Pajcash is its focus on cryptocurrencies built on the Solana blockchain. This focus makes it specialized and efficient for users in this ecosystem, which is growing in popularity due to Solana’s speed and low fees compared to other blockchains.
2. **Non-Custodial Platform:** \
   Pajcash is non-custodial, which means it doesn’t hold your cryptocurrency for you. Instead, you keep control of your funds in your own wallet until the moment of conversion.&#x20;
3. **Fast and Efficient Transactions:** \
   Pajcash is designed to process transactions quickly, addressing a common pain point in crypto off-ramping, where conversions can take hours or even days with some services.
4.  **Support for Small Transactions:**

    Unlike some crypto off-ramping services that prioritize large transactions, Pajcash is built to handle even small amounts of cryptocurrency efficiently. This is perfect for beginners who are experimenting with crypto or holding small amounts of tokens, making the service accessible to everyone.
5.  **Direct Bank Account Deposits:**

    Pajcash deposits the converted Naira directly into your Nigerian bank account, simplifying the process of accessing your money.
