# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## General

### 1. What do I need to get started with Pajcash?

To use Pajcash for on-ramping and off-ramping, you must first have a decentralized wallet set up. We recommend a wallet compatible with the Solana network, such as Solflare.

### 2. How do I create a Pajcash account?

You can create your account by going to [paj.cash](https://paj.cash/) and following the prompts to enter your details, link your bank, and connect your decentralized wallet.

### 3. Why do I need to link my bank account?

Linking your bank account is a necessary step that allows for seamless on-ramp and off-ramp transactions, enabling you to directly convert between fiat currency and crypto.

### 4. Are there any identity verification (KYC) requirements?

Yes, for security and regulatory compliance, Pajcash requires identity verification for certain transaction volumes and features. You will be prompted to complete this process when it is necessary.

### 5. What happens if I lose my wallet's private key or seed phrase?

Your wallet's private key or seed phrase is the sole key to your funds. Pajcash does not have access to or store this information. If you lose it, we cannot help you recover your assets. Always store your seed phrase in a safe and secure location.

## **On-Ramp and Off-Ramp Transactions**

### 6. What is the Pajaddress, and why do I need it?

The Pajaddress is a unique Solana-based deposit address found on your Pajcash dashboard. You use this address to send crypto to your Pajcash account for off-ramping transactions.

### 7. How do I convert crypto to cash (off-ramp)?

To off-ramp, simply copy your unique Pajaddress from your dashboard and send your supported token from your linked wallet to that address. The funds will then be automatically converted to your local currency and deposited into your linked bank account.

### 8. How do I buy crypto with local currency (on-ramp)?

Navigate to the "Buy" section of your dashboard, input the amount of Naira you want to spend, and specify your wallet address. After completing a bank transfer to the provided account details, the equivalent crypto will be sent to your wallet.

### 9. Are there transaction limits?

Yes, but these limits are subject to your bank account verification status. You can view your specific limits on your bank profile.

### 10. What are the fees for on-ramping and off-ramping?

Fees for transactions are dynamic and depend on various factors. The exact fees will be displayed on your screen before you confirm any on-ramp or off-ramp transaction.
