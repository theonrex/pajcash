# Pajcash Community Guidelines



Our community groups are a place for users to connect, share knowledge, and help one another. To ensure these spaces remain welcoming, respectful, and productive for everyone, we ask that you follow these guidelines. By participating, you agree to abide by these rules.

***

### 1. Be Respectful and Positive

Treat every member with kindness and respect. We are a diverse community, and we value different perspectives. We have a zero-tolerance policy for:

* Harassment, bullying, or hate speech of any kind.
* Personal attacks or insults.
* Discrimination based on race, gender, religion, or background.

### 2. Stay On-Topic and Add Value

Our groups are dedicated to discussions about Pajcash, on-ramping, off-ramping, and the world of crypto. To keep conversations productive, please:

* Avoid spamming or posting irrelevant content, including unrelated advertisements, links, or repetitive messages.
* Keep threads focused on the original topic.

### 3. Protect Your Privacy

Security is our top priority. Never share sensitive information in the group, including:

* Private keys, seed phrases, or wallet credentials.
* Pajcash account login details.
* Personal financial information or bank account numbers.
* Never click on suspicious links or share your screen with anyone asking for your account details. Admins will never ask you for this information.

### 4. No Financial Advice

The opinions shared in this group are for informational purposes only. Do not treat any advice from other members as professional financial advice. All decisions you make should be based on your own research.

### 5. Report, Don't Engage

If you encounter content or behavior that violates these guidelines, please do not engage in an argument. Instead, report the post or user directly to a moderator or admin. This helps us address issues quickly and maintain a positive environment for everyone.

Thank you for being a part of the Pajcash community and for helping us make it a great place for all.
