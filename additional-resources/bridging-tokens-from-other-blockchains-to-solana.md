# Bridging Tokens from Other Blockchains to Solana

If you have digital assets on other **blockchain networks**, you can easily bridge them to the **Solana** network to use with Pajcash's services.&#x20;

This guide uses deBridge, a popular cross-chain bridging platform.

1. Navigate to deBridge
   * Open your web browser and go to the deBridge application: [https://app.debridge.finance/](https://app.debridge.finance/).
2. Connect Your Wallet
   * Click the "Connect Wallet" button and select the wallet that contains the tokens you wish to bridge.
3. Select Your Source Chain and Token
   * In the "Pay" section, select the blockchain you are bridging from (e.g., Polygon).
   * Choose the specific token you want to bridge (e.g., MATIC) and the amount.
4. Set Solana as the Destination
   * In the "Receive" section, ensure that the destination blockchain is set to Solana and input your solana address or connect your solana wallet.
   * Select the token you want to receive on the Solana network (e.g., USDC).
5. Finalize the Bridge
   * Review all the transaction details, then click the "Bridge" button to initiate the transfer.

> Note: After the bridge is complete, you will need to have a small amount of the native Solana token (SOL) in your wallet to cover transaction fees for any subsequent transfers or actions on the Solana network.
