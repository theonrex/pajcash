### What is Pajcash:

[Pajcash](https://paj.cash/) is a cryptocurrency off-ramping and on-ramping project that allows users to convert Solana-based digital assets directly to Nigerian Naira in their bank accounts and vice versa.

In simpler terms, itâ€™s a platform that allows you to convert your cryptocurrency tokens into real cash, which is deposited directly into your bank account, as well as the ability to convert your Nigerian Naira into cryptocurrency.

Think of it like a bridge between the world of cryptocurrency, which exists online, and the traditional money you use for everyday things, such as buying groceries or paying bills. It allows for a seamless flow of value in both directions.\
