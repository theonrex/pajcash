# Security Practices

Security is paramount in the world of decentralized finance. This guide outlines the core security practices on Pajcash to help you protect your assets and stay safe from scams.

### **Understanding Non-Custodial Security**

Pajcash operates on a non-custodial model. This is a fundamental security feature that means we do not have access to or control over your digital assets. Your cryptocurrency is stored in your own decentralized wallet (like Solflare), and you hold the private keys (your secret recovery phrase).

Key Takeaways:

* You Own Your Keys, You Own Your Crypto: Pajcash is simply a bridge to facilitate transactions; we never hold your funds.
* Complete Control: You have full control and responsibility over your wallet and its contents.
* Enhanced Security: This model eliminates a central point of failure, meaning your funds are not vulnerable if our platform were ever compromised.

**Safety Measures for Transactions**

While the non-custodial model provides a strong foundation, following these practices will further secure your transactions:

* Secure Your Pajcash Account: Use a unique, strong password for your Pajcash account, incorporating a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. We highly recommend enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) if available.
* Protect Your Wallet's Seed Phrase: Your wallet's secret recovery phrase is the master key to your funds. Never share it with anyone, store it offline, and never type it into any website or application other than your official wallet recovery screen.
* Double-Check Addresses: Before sending any cryptocurrency, always double-check the recipient's wallet address. Scammers often use malware to alter addresses in your clipboard.
* Review Transaction Details: When approving a transaction with your wallet, carefully review all the details—the token, the amount, and the recipient address—before you sign.

**Tips for Avoiding Scams**

Scams in the crypto space are common, but they can be avoided by being vigilant.

* Never Share Your Seed Phrase: No legitimate service, including Pajcash, will ever ask for your secret recovery phrase. Anyone who asks for it is a scammer.
* Be Wary of Unsolicited Offers: Be extremely skeptical of "giveaways," "investment opportunities," or other offers that seem too good to be true.
* Verify Official Sources: Always access Pajcash through the official website: [https://paj.cash](https://paj.cash/). Be cautious of links sent via email, text, or social media, as they may lead to phishing sites designed to steal your information.
* Check Transaction Requests: If a transaction request pops up on your wallet unexpectedly, do not approve it. Scammers may try to trick you into signing malicious transactions that grant them access to your assets.
