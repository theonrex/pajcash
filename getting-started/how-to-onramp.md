#### How to On-Ramp: Buying Crypto with Naira

On-ramping is the process of converting your local currency (fiat) into cryptocurrency. Follow this guide to convert Nigerian Naira (NGN) into USDC directly to your wallet using Pajcash.

1. Navigate to the Buy Page
   * Go to your Pajcash dashboard and click on the "Buy" section, or navigate directly to the page here: [https://paj.cash/dashboard/buy](https://paj.cash/dashboard/buy).
2. Input Your Amount
   * In the designated field, enter the amount of Nigerian Naira (NGN) you wish to use for the transaction.
   * The platform will automatically display the equivalent, estimated amount of USDC you will receive for that value.
3. Enter Your Wallet Address
   * Enter the wallet address where you want the USDC to be sent.
   * It is highly recommended to use the same decentralized wallet you have already linked to your Pajcash account to ensure a smooth transaction.
4. Initiate the On-Ramp
   * Click the "On-Ramp" button.
   * A payment modal will appear, displaying the Pajcash account details (account number and bank name) where you need to send the Naira.
5. Complete the Bank Transfer
   * Copy the account details provided in the modal.
   * Open your banking app and transfer the exact amount of Naira you specified in Step 2 to the Pajcash account.

Once your bank transfer is confirmed, your USDC will be automatically sent to the wallet address you provided, and you will receive a notification.
