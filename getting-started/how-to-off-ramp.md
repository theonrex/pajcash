# How to Off-Ramp

**Off-ramping** is the process of converting your cryptocurrency back into fiat currency (like USD, EUR, or NGN) and having it sent to your linked bank account.&#x20;

**Hereâ€™s a simple, step-by-step guide to off-ramping with Pajcash.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important Pre-requisites:**

Before you begin, ensure the token you wish to off-ramp is a supported token on the Pajcash platform and is a token on the Solana network. Sending an unsupported token may result in the loss of your funds.

### **Step 1: Access Your Pajcash Dashboard**

First, log in to your Pajcash account at [paj.cash](https://paj.cash/). The dashboard is your central hub for managing all transactions.

### **Step 2: Locate Your Pajaddress**

On your dashboard, you will find your unique deposit address, which we refer to as your Pajaddress, where you will send your crypto for conversion.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Copy this address to your clipboard by clicking the copy icon beside the address.

### **Step 3: Send Funds from Your Wallet**

Open the decentralized wallet that you linked to your Pajcash account (e.g., Solflare, Phantom).

1. Select the specific token you want to withdraw from your list of assets.
2. Initiate a "Send" or "Withdraw" transaction.
3. Paste your copied Paj address into the recipient field.
4. Confirm the amount you wish to send and approve the transaction within your wallet.

I**mportant:** Always double-check that you have pasted the correct Paj address before confirming the transaction to avoid sending your funds to the wrong address.
{% endhint %}

### **Step 4: Receive Funds in Your Bank Account**

Once the transaction is confirmed on the Solana network, Pajcash will automatically convert your crypto to your local currency.&#x20;

The corresponding amount will be sent directly to the bank account you linked during your initial setup. You will receive a notification once the funds have been successfully deposited into your bank account.
